# CarND-Vehicle-Detection-and-Tracking
Udacity CarND Vehicle Detection and Tracking Project

The goal of this project is to reliably identify the location of vehicles in a video stream of a front facing camera mounted centraly in a moving vehicle.

TODO: insert gif of the result

## Project Structure

- `test_images/` Directory with images to test vechicle identification
- `examples/` Directory with example images used in the writeup
- `videos/` Directory with input and output videos
- `Vehicle-Detection-and-Tracking.ipnyb` Jupyter notebook with all the project code and example images
- `README.md` Projecte writeup (you're reading it)

## Project Overview

- **Reading Labeled Data** - We start by reading in the labeled data provided

- **Feature Extraction** - We then extract the desired features

- **Scalling Features** - We continue by scalling these features

- **Training the Classifier** - We train the classifier: a Linear Support Vector Classification, or SVC

- **Detecting Vehicles** - We use the previsouly trained classifier to identify vehicles in a video stream

- **Video Augmentation** - We finaly augment the video with the vehicles detected within rectangles

## Reading Labeled Data

We start by reading and analysing the provided data, this is separated into `vechicles` and `non-vehicles` data. The data set included **8792** examples of vehicle images and **8968** examples of non vehicle images.
